# ReactFlow Project

## Expectations
1. Create this project in your github account and share the link to it after you are done.
2. You should think about the UI and UX of your app.
3. But all UX is up to you, you can use any UI library
4. You should think about the state management of your app.
5. You should build this application using Reactjs(Typescript will be a plus).

## Family Tree Challenge
Here you have a ReactFlow project that already has functionality for adding new nodes
You need to add functionality to it to complete following steps:

### Step 1
Every time user creates a new node ask them to provide a name and gender for that node
Display this data in a new node

### Step 2
Every time user adds a new node add a bg color for that node
1. #ffe7e7 if female
2. #d2d9e9 if male

### Step 3
When user deletes a node ask him what to do with the tree part that comes out of it
1. Option 1 - delete the remaining tree
2. Option 2 - allocate remaining tree to a parent of the node that is being deleted

### Step 4
Add functionality to add a node in the middle of the tree

## What we are looking for---
1. Simple, clear, readable code. How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
2. Correctness Does the application do what it promises? Can we find bugs or trivial flaws?
3. Memory efficiency How will it behave in case of large datasets? Are results cached? Do you have debounce on your search?
4. Testing How well tested your application is? Can you give some metrics?
